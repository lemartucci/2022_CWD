### Final Proposal
1. **User Profile**
    1. **Target User Persona: Wildlife Disease Expert in Midwest**

        Our hypothetical wildlife disease expert has been studying the spread of CWD in the midwest and has been tasked by the Department of Fish & Wildlife with redesigning/updating state-wide monitoring, prevention, and reporting programs based on past and present CWD data and policies. It will be important to collaborate with wildlife disease experts and policy makers in neighboring states and to use a data visualization tool to identify areas of greatest concern in order to focalize monitoring, prevention, and community education efforts. The ability to **identify** areas of greatest concern/risk, **compare** CWD cases across states, counties, and regions over time, and **rank** areas by CWD cases is imperative for evaluating current policies and management practices and informing revisions to those policies and management practices. In using the interactive CWD map, the wildlife disease expert intends to determine **causations** of spread, analyze **patterns** and **trends** and identify **outliers** so that they can share their **insights** and recommendations for CWD mitigation efforts to the Department of Fish & Wildlife. Additionally, the wildlife expert will work on increasing awareness of CWD through educational outreach programs geared towards the general public and the hunting community; to accomplish this **goal**, they will reference the intereactive CWD map and share it as a resource for interested parties.

    2. **User Case Scenario**

        When accessing the CWD map, the wildlife disease expert is welcomed with a popup that provides a textual overview for navigating the site and a clear entry point for interaction with a "click here to begin" button. Upon closing the popup they see a static map of the United States that shows the spread of CWD in the contiguous U.S. They quickly **identify** areas of CWD spread, and begin scrolling. Below the static map of the U.S. Below the static map of the U.S. there is an interactive map of the midwest containing Wisconsin, Michigan, Missouri, Iowa, and Illinois.
