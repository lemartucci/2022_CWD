### Final Proposal
1. **User Profile**
    1. **Target User Persona: Wildlife Disease Expert in Midwest**

        Our hypothetical wildlife disease expert has been studying the spread of CWD in the midwest and has been tasked by the Department of Fish & Wildlife with redesigning/updating state-wide monitoring, prevention, and reporting programs based on past and present CWD data and policies. It will be important to collaborate with wildlife disease experts and policy makers in neighboring states and to use a data visualization tool to identify areas of greatest concern in order to focalize monitoring, prevention, and community education efforts. The ability to **identify** areas of greatest concern/risk, **compare** CWD cases across states, counties, and regions over time, and **rank** areas by CWD cases is imperative for evaluating current policies and management practices and informing revisions to those policies and management practices. In using the interactive CWD map, the wildlife disease expert intends to determine **causations** of spread, analyze **patterns** and **trends** and identify **outliers** so that they can share their **insights** and recommendations for CWD mitigation efforts to the Department of Fish & Wildlife. Additionally, the wildlife expert will work on increasing awareness of CWD through educational outreach programs geared towards the general public and the hunting community; to accomplish this **goal**, they will reference the interactive CWD map and share it as a resource for interested parties.

    2. **User Case Scenario**

        When accessing the CWD map, the wildlife disease expert is welcomed with a popup that provides a textual overview for navigating the site and a clear entry point for interaction with a "click here to begin" button. Upon closing the popup they see an introduction to CWD, an interactive donut chart that shows CWD cases in wild and captive cervids by Midwest state, and a static map of CWD spread in the contiguous U.S. They are quickly able to gain **insight** into state-level cervid CWD case makeup by interacting with the donut chart and viewing the static map of the U.S. which enables them to **identify** and **compare** areas of CWD spread and examine **clusters** of CWD outbreaks. Interested in the Midwest, they click "Midwest" in the top menu bar and arrive at the interactive map of CWD spread and policy for the Midwest; they **filter** the data to display state level CWD data which generates proportional symbols over each state; interested in change over time they click on the temporal **sequence** tool. The proportional symbols change to display CWD cases in 5 year intervals.They notice Wisconsin is an **outlier** in that it has seen the largest growth of CWD cases in the Midwest over time. They click on Wisconsin and a popup appears, **retrieving** the year and exact CWD case number for Wisconsin. Interested in visualizing additional data, they **overlay** the number of hunters registered per state and subsequently the number of deer harvested per state, both layers depicted as choropleth base maps, placed under the case numbers proportional symbols.
