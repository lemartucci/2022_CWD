### Final Proposal
1. Persona/Scenario
    1. ** Target User Persona: Wildlife Disease Expert in Midwest**

        Our hypothetical wildlife disease expert has been studying the spread of CWD in the midwest and has been tasked by the Department of Fish & Wildlife with redesigning/updating state-wide monitoring, prevention, and reporting programs based on past and present CWD data and policies. It will be important to collaborate with wildlife disease experts and policy makers in neighboring states and to use a data visualization tool to identify areas of greatest concern in order to focalize monitoring, prevention, and community education efforts. The ability to **identify** areas of greatest concern/risk, **compare** CWD cases across states, counties, and regions over time, and **rank** areas by CWD cases is imperative for evaluating current policies and management practices and informing revisions to those policies and management practices. In using the interactive CWD map, the wildlife disease expert intends to determine **causations** of spread, analyze **patterns** and **trends** and identify **outliers** so that they can accomplish their goal of presenting their **insights** and recommendations for CWD efforts to the Department of Fish & Wildlife.
